## LaTex Formulas

$$ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$

$$ \sum_{i=0}^{n}ar^i $$

$$ \sum_{i = 1}^n(i) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4+\ldots...n=\frac{(n)(n+1)} 2$$

## 1) the hardest part in my opinion was creating the LaTex Formulas, the instruction video helped me understanding what exactly I had to do, the rest was pretty much streight forward.

## 2) Codespase is very similar to VisualStudio Code, that's why I was confortable with it, but probably because I didn't install all the extensions it was a little less automative. But overall I really liked it because I was already confortable with this type of layout
