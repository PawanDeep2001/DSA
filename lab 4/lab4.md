# Lab 4 Reflection and Observations

* Pawan Deep
* Tarlok Kaur
* Pushpinder Kaur

## Simple sorts

	* which algorithm did you find easiest to understand? 
	 ANS: bubble sort

	* which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort? 
	 ANS: insertion sort


## Merging Unsorted lists

	* how long did this take
	 ANS: It took 3:08 minutes

	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)? 
	 ANS: yes, because we picked the wrong numbers.

	* How many times? 
	 ANS: 3 times
	


## Merging Sorted lists

	* how long did this take
	 ANS: it took 1:37 minutes

	* did you make any mistakes along the way (did you choose the wrong number and had to move things around)?
	 ANS: No, we didn't make any mistake.

	* How many times? 
	 ANS: 0 times

## Sorting larger data sets

|Team member      | Sorting time|
|-----------------|-------------|
| Pawan Deep      |        3:46 |
| Tarlok Kaur     |        3:32 |
| Pushpinder Kaur |        4:02 |

What was fastest time?
	 ANS: 3 min 32 sec


Describe the algorithm produced by the team member with fastest time.

Tarlok was the member who had the fastest time, we all used Insertion algorithm but because the numbers we had to sort were 48, I and Pushpinder did it a bit slower and we did a few mistakes too. In this algorithm we need to start sorting from the start, so first of all we compare the first with the second, and then we set the smaller to the 1st position, and then we compare 2nd with 3rd if they are not in order we compare then the 3rd with the first one, then once we got the sorted list till the third element we check the 4th with the 3rd if it's greater we don't have to do anything otherwise swap and then compare it will the previous numbers and so on.

## Partitioning

* how long did it take to partition the data set?

* ANS: 5 min 54 sec

## Sorting the small piles

* how long did it take for you to sort all of the little piles?

* ANS: 4 min 10 sec

## Putting it together

* As a team discuss things that helped sort the papers... what was useful? what was fast to do?  What was slow?
* ANS1: So to sort the papers, we first analyzed the code so that we understand what that sort was doing, after that, we watched the video that was showing what actually was happening for each iteration, and then we tried it once just to understand better and then we began with the actual test. The Fastest one was insertion sort when we had fewer papers to sort and partition sort when we had a larger set of papers The slowest one was Bubble Sort. 

* As a team come up with a description of how best to sort a set of numbers on paper.
* ANS2: We came up with the solution that the fastest sort for a little set of numbers on paper is insertion sort, that allows us to start sorting right away from the starting where the other sorts for example selection sort we find the minimum in all the data set that as first then the second and so on, on the other side the bubble sort we continuously compare 2 numbers and we will continuously grab the largest to the 2nd position if it isn't already in the second position between those 2 numbers.
* Mix up all your numbers and have each member of the team perform the sort you did.  How long did it take?
* ANS3: My sort was selection.
* Pawan Deep -> 5 min 30 sec
* Pushpinder Kaur -> 6 min 20 sec
* Tarlok Kaur -> 5 min 42 sec
